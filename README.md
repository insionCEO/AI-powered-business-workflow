# AI Flow

**AI Flow** is an open source, user-friendly UI application that empowers you to seamlessly connect multiple AI models together, specifically leveraging the capabilities of **ChatGPT**. This unique tool paves the way to creating interactive networks of different AI models, fostering a multi-perspective response to various prompts.

Imagine setting up a simple workflow where:

- One node generates a poem
- One node gives a review of the poem
- One node create a prompt for the cover of the poem
- One node render the cover

N.B : There will be more powerful AI than DALL-E to generate images in the near future of the app (Stable Diffusion, MidJourney)

If we want to change the idea of the poem, we can edit the first node, and keep the same flow.

This flow logic can then be applied to different inputs, yielding varied results for similar subject matter. 

**AI Flow is particularly useful for content creation.** By enabling different GPT models to adopt different roles, AI Flow orchestrates the creation and evaluation of digital content, from social media threads to blog articles. 


Our primary goal with AI Flow is to democratize access to AI interactions, enabling anyone to create and manage their own AI networks right from their personal computer. In addition, we value your autonomy and control over costs. With AI Flow, you utilize your own OpenAI keys, giving you full authority over your budget. Importantly, the software runs locally on your machine, assuring you of privacy and control over your data and operations.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that AI Flow is still under active development. At present, it is constrained by the maximum input size supported by GPT models. However, we're hard at work devising solutions to this limitation, and we're excited about rolling out updates in future releases.

## Features

In a nutshell, AI Flow provides a visual platform for crafting and managing AI-driven workflows, thereby facilitating diverse and dynamic AI interactions.

- üé® It offers a drag-and-drop interface to design these workflows
- üìä Monitors their execution in real-time
- üóÇÔ∏è AI models can be conveniently managed and organized
- üíæ Workflows can be exported or imported for sharing or backup purposes

## Other basic use cases
