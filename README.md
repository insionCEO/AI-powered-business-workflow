**AI Flow** is an open source, user-friendly UI application that empowers you to seamlessly connect multiple AI models together, specifically leveraging the capabilities of **ChatGPT**. This unique tool paves the way to creating interactive networks of different AI models, fostering a multi-perspective response to various prompts.


Imagine setting up a simple workflow where:

- One node generates a poem
- One node gives a review of the poem
- One node creates a prompt for the cover of the poem
- One node makes the cover with Stable Diffusion

![image-scenario-1-1](assets/scenario-1-1.png)

If we want to change the idea of the poem, we can edit the first node, and keep the same flow.

This flow logic can then be applied to different inputs, yielding varied results for similar subject matter. 

**AI Flow is particularly useful for content creation.** By enabling different GPT models to adopt different roles, AI Flow orchestrates the creation and evaluation of digital content, from social media threads to blog articles. 

With AI Flow, you utilize your own OpenAI keys, giving you full authority over your budget. Importantly, the software runs locally on your machine, assuring you of privacy and control over your data and operations.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that very large input _(for example the transcript of a 1 hour podcast)_ may incur additionnal costs, because for this type of entry the default behavior is to split the input into chunks, create embeddings **(with the OpenAI API)**, and then use a similarity search to find the right items to answer the prompt. 

> N.B : For large inputs, you'll get better result with a precise prompt.

## Features

In a nutshell, AI Flow provides a visual platform for crafting and managing AI-driven workflows, thereby facilitating diverse and dynamic AI interactions.

- üé® It offers a drag-and-drop interface to design these workflows
- üìä Monitors their execution in real-time
- üóÇÔ∏è AI models can be conveniently managed and organized
- üíæ Workflows can be exported or imported for sharing or backup purposes

## Other basic use cases

#### Summarize web pages & youtube transcript

#### Use pre-made prompts to build quickly

#### Split input with AI

> By combining those features we can create different flows.

#### Create a custom layout for your flow

When your flow is complete, you have the option to run it as is or create a custom layout focusing on the most interesting part.
